General script to counter performerid's with greater than n-entries:
select performerid, count(*) as cust_count
from aerolink_tab
group by performerid having count(*) > 200000;

To create an Impala table:
impala-shell -i localhost -f file_name_of_table_schema.sql

To determine number of Aerolink log entries (using performerid):
select count(performerid) as num_users from aerolink_tab;

To determine number of unique "somethings" in a given column:
select distinct performerid
from aerolink_tab;

select auditstr, performerid from aerolink_tab
where auditstr = 'ZipAndDownload' 
limit 50;

The following script tells me that the aerolink_tab file is
at least hosed with the auditstr field. This should group each
Aerolink command and the number of times it is used:
select auditstr, count(*) as comm_count
from aerolink_tab
group by auditstr;
